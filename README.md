If you’re having trouble downloading a file directly, one workaround is to create the file locally using a single shell command. Copy and paste the command below into your terminal to create an `INSTALL.md` file with the instructions:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > INSTALL.md
# Install Instructions

1. **Install Rust**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions—the installer will set up Rust, Cargo (Rust’s build tool), and rustup.
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Restart Your Terminal or Load the Environment**  
   Either restart your terminal or run:
   ```sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**  
   Check the versions of Rust and Cargo:
   ```sh
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

4. **Download the Network Tools Repository**  
   Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:tburgess7/network_tools2.git
   ```

5. **Compile the Project**  
   Navigate to the project directory and build in release mode:
   ```sh
   cd network_tools2
   cargo build --release
   ```
EOF
```

After running that command, you'll have an `INSTALL.md` file in your current directory containing the install instructions in Markdown format. You can then open, edit, or share the file as needed.
